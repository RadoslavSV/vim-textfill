DESCRIPTION                                                                    *textfill-description*

    "vim-textfill" is a powerful plugin designed to enhance the user's text-filling experience within Vim.
    It provides convenient commands to generate random realistic text, saving time and effort when populating documents.

    Using "vim-textfill" the user can easily insert random country names. Whether they need to create sample data,
    simulate real-world scenarios, or add variety to their content, this feature allows them to quickly and effortlessly
    generate diverse country names. In addition to country names, the plugin offers the analogical functionality with real cities
    and street names.
    When in need to think of human names (whether first, middle or last), some people may encounter unneccessary difficulties and thus
    the plugin has functionalities for generating at random each of the following combinations: male/female first/last names
    (the last name functionality can be used for middle names as well, since they are practically the same).
    The cool thing here, which I may say makes this plugin a "one-of-a-kind" is that all aforementioned functionalities work with both
    English and Bulgarian languages. The user must only input the initial letter (EN or BG) and it automatically detects what 
    type of word to generate.
    Another utility of the plugin is that is generates fully random 10-digit phone numbers, always starting with '0'. It can also generate
    a random (pseudo-random) integer from a given (by the user) range.
    For those moments when placeholder text or need to fill a specific word count is needed, the plugin provides the "Lorem" command.
    This command retrieves a specified number of words from a preloaded Lorem Ipsum text file, allowing the user to tailor the length
    of the generated text to match the exact requirements.

    By automating the process of generating random text, "vim-textfill" eliminates the need to search for or manually type out
    repetitive or unrealistic content. It simplifies the workflow, ensuring that the writer can focus on the core aspects of their
    work without being distracted by the tedious task of generating placeholder text.

INSTALLATION                                                                   *textfill-installation*

    You can clone my repo that contains the whole directory structure with all needed files to run the plugin.
    URL: www.github.com/RadoslavSV/vim-textfill.git
    Or you can create the dir structure and all files manually.
    Place the "vim-textfill" directory in your main Vim directory and now in it you have everything you need.
    You will need to adjust your absolute path to the "src" directory, in the very first row of autoload\textfill.vim file.
    Change the value of g:absolute_path variable to your corresponding absolute path to src\ in order for the script to be able
    to access the source txt files there.

=========================================================================================================================================
USAGE                                                                          *textfill-usage*

    In order to use the plugin functionalities, the user execute one of the following commands in the commandline, whilst in Normal mode.
      1) :Country 
      2) :City
      3) :Street
      4) :MFirstName
      5) :FFirstName
      6) :MLastName
      7) :FLastName
      8) :Phone
      9) :RandomNumber <arg-1> <arg-2>
     10) :Lorem <arg-1>

    Commands 1 - 7, must be executed while the cursor is at a letter (English or Bulgarian) and it will pick a random word from the
    corresponding source file and place it exactly after the cursor, shifting all characters after the cursor to the right
    "length-of-the-word" times. I.e. it will autocomplete the started word. It works both with Bulgarian written letters and with
    English written letters. It also works with either uppercase or lowercase first letter, without changing it.
    Example: if the cursor is at letter 'd' and the line is "abcdef" and the user executes :Country, the line may become
    "abcdenmarkef" (if Denmark is picked). Other example: the cursor is at 'Б' in line "41тБt2" and the user executes :FLastName,
    the result line will look like "41тБорисоваt2".
    
    Command 8, can be executed regardless of what is under the cursor (best option is if it's empty). The user executes :Phone and
    random 10-digit phone number-imitation is generated and placed right at the cursor. The only constant here is that the phone
    number will always begin with the digit '0' (zero). The following nine digits are generated at random in the range [0-9].
    
    Command 9 accepts two mandatory parameters. The first one is the lower bound of the range and the second one is the upper bound.
    They must fullfill the requirement "<arg-1> is less than <arg-2>". If <arg-1> >= <arg-2>, there will be an error message and no result.
    :RandomNumber can be called anywhere and it will generate a random integer number and place it at the cursor (similar to command 8).

    Command 10 needs exactly one argument which is a number (that must be <= 13560, because that is the total number of words present
    in lorem.txt) and prints that number of filler words from a source "Lorem ipsum"-style file, right after the cursor.

SETTINGS                                                                       *textfill-settings*

    The "vim-textfill" plugin does not need any additional settings to run properly. Just Vim installed on the machine.

ISSUES                                                                         *textfill-issues*

    Encountered issues so far:
      1) When one of the commands numbered 1-7 is executed, whilst the cursor is at unexpected character (different from EN or BG letter)
      the behaviour is undefined. It may truncate the next character, it may place some unwanted characters as <B-0> and so on.

      2) When one of the commands numbered 1-7 is executed, whilst the cursor is at empty space (doesn't have any character on it),
      a random word is picked out of the whole list of possible words from the corresponding to the command file and is placed there, but
      without its first digits, because the functions work that way normally - they are not intended to place the whole word, but
      instead they paste only the substring of the word starting from the second digit. This is so, because this way the script handles
      both lowercase and uppercase first letters easily.
